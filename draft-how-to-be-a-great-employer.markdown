Over the years, I have worked for quite a number of different companies from completely different industries.
One thing they all had in common though: They were based on creative knowledge-workers. Designers, programmers, product guys, administrators, you name it.
And almost all made the same mistakes when it comes to how you should treat your employees.

Now let's talk about what this means.

__TODO__

- Salary. Don't try to start out with cheapest offer you can come up. Start out at least competitive. There is nothing unsexier than starting as cheap as possible and it immediately makes good people want to bail
- Product. In order to care about it, I need a product that solves a concrete problem and is not sales-driven. Bonus points: It makes the world a better place.
- Commute / home office
- "The mission": If you're just exit-driven, don't bother to approach me. I want to work with real entrepeneurs - that means people who care about the product, the company and the employees and not about the quickest exit possible.

The intricacies:

- Overhours. They might be necessary sometimes but they certainly should not be the rule.
- Don't try to enforce a company culture. This just happens or ...it doesn't. The only thing you as an employer can do is set up the environment for it. Having semi-automated, semi-mandatory team events every month is not the right way to do it.
- Meetings in general. Don't do it unless you a) have an agenda, b) have a moderator and c) have a tight time frame.
- No interruptions. Or at least schedule them properly. You know what happens when you interrupt a programmer, don't you?
- Give your team time to learn and develop myself. It always puzzles me that in an industry where knowledge and learning is everything you'll rarely find companies that give you time to learn. You'll hear crap like "We'd like to do it, but we're not google". Guess what, genius, that's exactly the reason why you're not google. One day a month for open source work and learning new languages and technologies is a win-win for everybody.
- Don't be cheap. Don't make me explain why I need this ebook which costs you 20 Dollars. Don't try to find the cheapest accomodation possible for a conference. It's  disrespectful and it kills my motivation.
- Involve your team in the product. If you treat people like ticket slaves this is exactly what you get: ticket slaves.
