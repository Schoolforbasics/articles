One of my goals in life is to create something that matters together with the greatest minds of our times and to solve challenging and interesting technological problems while doing it.

There are many inspirations and inspirational people in my life. A more or less random selection of the top of my head: Zappos team culture (love the book!), Carol Dweck, google (lame, I know), Elon Musk and literally everything he touches, buffer and their transparency policy, SpaceX and about 1000 more. Check out my blog for more.

### What I bring to the table:

* __Excellence in software engineering.__ I’ve been doing this for the last 15 years and I’m obsessed with code quality and writing elegant, maintainable code. I am a regular open source contributor and maintainer of a couple of more or less popular gems. Most notably of the awesome Reek gem - check out my github profile for more. Additionally you can find quite a few mostly technical articles on my blog. My first real love was and is Ruby but I consider myself to be polyglot at heart. Go, Elixir, Clojure, Prolog, ook, you name it. I also love to build up the "big picture": devops, services, protocols, contract-driven development, cloud hosting and so on.

* __Building up teams by recruiting the best people.__ I'd go as far as to say that team play is 10 times more important than "being an expert" since it's far easier to become good at something than transitioning from being a douche to somebody who can carry and motivate a team. I summarised quite a few of my thoughts on my blog.

* __The will to see things through__ and to go the last mile to achieve my goal. On the plus side this means I'm extremely passionate but on the downside this means that I come across quite intense sometimes.

* __The passion to create something that might change change the world.__ I don't care much for money - my motivation lies elsewhere. This doesn't mean that I work for free, just that I value other things more.
