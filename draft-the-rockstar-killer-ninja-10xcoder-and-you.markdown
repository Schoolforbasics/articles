I have been doing tech recruiting for start-ups over the last 10 years and oh boy, did I fuck up a lot. On the plus side of things, I did also learn a lot about human behaviour, [hiring bias](http://recruiterbox.com/blog/remove-hiring-bias-from-recruitment-process/) and common misconceptions about what constitutes a "good" team member. 

I have seen the biggest douche bags called the "top performers" and the actual performers "constant underachievers". Actually that's a pretty common topic I have seen across companies. Human perception is pretty freakin' bad. We overvalue merits that are tangible and undervalue merits that are kind of fuzzy. For instance, a classical set up I probably have seen dozens of time is the rockstar developer (sometimes also referred to as [ninja](TODO) or [killer](TODO))that delivers this super useful new backend feature that will be used on the web frontend everybody has been waiting for. 

Problem is that he didn't really care about communicating this. QA is missing. Normally not an issue since developers work in a squad where QA is a part of the team (you're doing this, right?) but that rockstar never actually fit in anywhere in so you kind of let him work on his own (what could possibly go wrong?). Supervision by the product team was spotty at best since nobody there really got along with our that dev (which imposes a high entry barrier for communications) and as a consequence the killer feature everybody has been waiting is not **really** the thing that people have been expecting. Customer Care doesn't know about it. And the frontend team has no clue that they should integrate this feature and more importantly, how.
6 months later - the feature still not being live - your CEO barges in and asks you why the hell it is still not live.

Now there are obviously a lot of things that went wrong (and not just with that single developer) but in most cases the overall perception will be that the rockstar developer delivered. While the other teams failed to so.

**So how can you make sure this doesn't happen to you?**

Apart from the organisational problems the obvious solution to this is not hiring those kind of guys. The problem is that "common recruiting wisdom" says to look for developers that are technically capable first and then look for their so called "soft skills" (which is a very fuzzy term which roughly translates to "the candidate should not be an obvious asshole").

I think the way most companies evaluate candidates for tech jobs (probably for all jobs) is upside down.

### Empathy is king

![Empathy](https://mcclewis.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/gregory-colbert-man-animal-04.jpg)


There was a fascinating article in the New York Times recently that was called [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html). Google had been trying to find out what kind of behavioural patterns all their successful teams shared. To their surprise, all the obvious metrics failed. Common wisdom like "Put the best guys in a squad" did not work out sometimes and they couldn't really figure out why. Then, after years, they basically realised that all successful teams shared 2 traits (quoting from the article directly):

>>
As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’
Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

I had never thought about it this (apparently nobody had) but in hindsight, this seems to make sense, doesn't it?

So what if you're not exactly the most emphatic person on this planet?

One of the biggest lessons in life that I learned is that [talent does not exist](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/56a0ec0de6183ebe4a8bab61-1190-625/ufc-champion-conor-mcgregor-has-a-great-perspective-on-what-it-takes-to-be-successful.jpg) which in turn means that you can learn anything. Like empathy. I personally liked [Chad Fowler's approach](http://lifehacker.com/why-empathy-is-your-most-important-skill-and-how-to-pr-1505011685) approach and [Six Habits of Highly Empathic People](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_empathic_people1). 

### Communication

![Communication](http://10936-presscdn-0-17.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Labor-of-love.jpg)

The best pundit in his field is utterly worthless if he can't communicate properly.

Again, this is a fuzzy field. I have seen people write huge fyi mails by default as part of a "cover your ass" mentality.

What makes for good communication?

* Being succinct but still assuming that your receiver has little knowledge about the topic. Yes, that means you should always start with a short introduction and not jump right into the middle even when you think that all stakeholders already know what it is about. Because they probably are not. 
* Knowing whom to include
* Even more important: Knowing whom to exclude because the topic is not relevant. Having half the company on cc is not only pointless, it's also damaging because a lot people **will** read those mails and waste quite some time doing so. I think [Jeff Bezo's 2 pizza rule](http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-for-productive-meetings-2013-10?IR=T) does not only apply to meetings, it applies to communication in general (with the rare exception for topics that really are of interest for a broader audience)
* 100 other attributes I won't list here because smarter people than me have written [quite](TODO) [some](TODO) [books](TODO) about this topic.

Bottom line here is, all of those attributes should be part of hiring evaluation as well.
 

### Motivation

![How bad do you want it?](http://etinspires.com/wp-materials/uploads/2013/11/hbdywi-600x400.jpg)

There was an interesting thread about the mythical 10x developer [on hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4954003) a while ago.

One of the top comments caught my eye:

>> I'm a 10x developer most of the time. It's all about motivation. When I'm producing 10 times as much as my peers, I'm working on something I want to work on. I can go all day without visiting facebook, reddit or hacker news, because I simply would rather be working than be reading those sites. Any time I see these kinds of articles that tell you to have "discipline" to not read those kinds of sites, I think they have it all wrong. You're only addressing the symptom.
When I'm forced to work on something I don't think maters, I'm not a 10x developer. I'm really obsessed with code quality, so any task that involves refactoring, I am 10x or even 50x. If the task is to track down a complex bug in a PHP system, and I'm under strict orders to not refactor anything (which is common), then I will be a 0.01x developer. With my personal projects, I'm always 10x or more.

The key part here is

>> When I'm producing 10 times as much as my peers, I'm working on something I want to work on.

You should hire motivated people only. That sounds like an empty phrase because nobody would disagree with openly. But I've almost never seen any company that actually really made this a relevant attribute in your hiring process.


### Experience

You can learn everything for sure but there just things you **need** to have experienced yourself. You need to have shut down the production database in your life to **really** understand that you need to be careful what console window you're typing in what. You need to have deployed that critical bug that cost your company....


### Structured and analytical approach

Do a lot of your projects look like this?

![Success](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HArgrMPQ3NI/UFCL1BVeJDI/AAAAAAAAAHg/4ZvTDUSmeVY/s1600/E+to+P+Visual+Aid.jpg)

Mine too.

We're humans and human will go for the quickest reward possible. And what's the quickest reward in software development? Programming. Doing something. Getting shit done.
Problem is that often you don't know what "Getting shit done" actually means. Usually you need to talk to a lot of people, understand problems in depth, research possible solutions, read on things, prepare an action plan of how to do things and why. Which is something that is not particularly rewarding and in worst case so painful, that people shy away from it.

Someone with a structured and analytical approach will do all of the above and more **before** even writing one single line of code.

### Technical knowledge

![Technical Knowledge](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/51744411.jpg)

Alright, so here it is: Technical knowledge is the **least important** attribute I'm looking for in a developer. 
Why?
Because over the years I found out that it's way harder to develop skills like empathy than it is to develop technical skills. Somebody who is diligent and analytical, has the energy and the drive, communicates well with the team and knows how to deal with people in general will pick up tech skills fast. Very fast.

### Ok, so what now?

It's easy to fall prey to conventional recruiting wisdom. It's easy because it offers you the quickest reward possible: It will get you a lot of candidates fast because it just offers you a bunch of core metrics that don't matter that much in the bigger picture. 

"Proficient in language x"? Check.
"Experience in maintaining y"? Check.
"Cultural fit"? Well, he seems to be nice and all that, so check as well!

Unfortunately it's not so easy to ......
